Overview: Notebooks for exploratory analysis, visualization, and inspecting pruned models and rollouts.

Usage: Open with Jupyter or VS Code; ensure the Python environment matches the project and that paths/configs point to your data and checkpoints.

Contents:
- activations.ipynb: Explore and visualize intermediate activations/attention.
- pruned_models.ipynb: Inspect and compare sparsity patterns and behavior of pruned models.
- sandbox.ipynb: Scratch space for quick experiments and ad hoc analysis.
- visualize_long_analysis.ipynb: Visualize metrics and outputs from long-horizon analysis runs.
- visualize_short_analysis.ipynb: Visualize metrics and outputs from short-horizon analysis runs.
