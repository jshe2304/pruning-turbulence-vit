# Pruning Turbulence Vision Transformers

What is the effect of pruning on vision transformers used for fluid dynamics emulation? 
- How far can we prune a fluid emulator before it becomes useless? 
- Does removing overparameterization eliminate spurious correlation and promote generalizability?
- What can we observe during the pruning process that give insight into model internals?
